# 🎉 RESOLUTION COMPLETE: eBay API Connection Test Fixed

## ✅ **FINAL STATUS**: All Issues Resolved Successfully

### **Problem Solved**: 
eBay credentials were configured but connection tests were failing even with valid production credentials.

### **Root Cause**: 
Architectural flaws in `EbayApiService.cs` that prevented proper credential retrieval and connection validation.

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED**:

### 1. **Service Architecture Fixed**
- ✅ Added missing `ICredentialService` dependency to `EbayApiService` constructor
- ✅ Fixed credential retrieval in `RefreshAccessTokenAsync()` to use actual stored credentials
- ✅ Updated `TestConnectionAsync()` to properly validate credential availability

### 2. **OAuth Configuration Corrected**
- ✅ Fixed OAuth endpoint from `https://api.ebay.com` to `https://auth.ebay.com`
- ✅ Implemented proper token refresh mechanism with real credentials

### 3. **Production Environment Configuration**
- ✅ Updated all default configurations from sandbox to production
- ✅ Changed URLs: `api.sandbox.ebay.com` → `api.ebay.com`
- ✅ Set environment defaults to "production"

### 4. **Process Reliability Enhanced**
- ✅ Added semaphore protection with proper `finally` blocks
- ✅ Implemented exception handling to prevent semaphore leaks
- ✅ Enhanced rate limiting robustness

## 🚀 **VERIFICATION RESULTS**:

### **Connection Test**: ✅ `"isConnected": true`
### **Credential Status**: ✅ Configured with production environment
### **Application Status**: ✅ Running on `https://localhost:5001`
