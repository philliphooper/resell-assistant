## Key Algorithm Features

### Price Discrepancy Detection
```csharp
// Groups similar products across marketplaces
var productGroups = GroupSimilarProducts(allProducts);

// Finds price differences
var cheapest = products.OrderBy(p => p.Price + p.ShippingCost).First();
var mostExpensive = products.OrderByDescending(p => p.Price).First();
var potentialProfit = mostExpensive.Price - cheapest.TotalCost;
```

### Intelligent Product Matching
- **Keyword extraction** - Removes common words, focuses on product identifiers
- **Similarity scoring** - Calculates match percentage based on shared keywords
- **Normalization** - Handles variations in titles, conditions, formats

### Deal Scoring System
- **Profit margin scoring** (0-40 points) - Higher margins = better scores
- **Absolute profit scoring** (0-30 points) - Considers total dollar profit
- **Demand scoring** (0-30 points) - Popular brands/categories get bonuses
- **Confidence adjustment** - Reduces score for uncertain deals

## Live Testing Results ✅

**Test Command**: `GET /api/deals/discover?maxResults=5`

**Sample Result**:
```json
{
  "id": 0,
  "productId": 0,
  "potentialProfit": 99.00,
  "estimatedSellPrice": 588.99,
  "dealScore": 100,
  "confidence": 80,
  "reasoning": "Found price discrepancy: Buy for $489.99 (eBay), sell for $588.99 (eBay). Profit margin: 20.2%."
}
```
