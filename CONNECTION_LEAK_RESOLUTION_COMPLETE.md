# Connection Leak Resolution - Issue #17

**Date:** June 2, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED**  
**GitHub Issue:** https://github.com/philliphooper/resell-assistant/issues/17

## Problem Summary
Dashboard was displaying immediate "API Connection Failed" and "Failed to load statistics" error messages on page load instead of showing proper loading states, due to critical connection leak issues.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Shared AbortController**: The `ConnectionManager` singleton was sharing a single `AbortController` across all API requests, causing new requests to abort previous ones
2. **Process Multiplication**: Multiple `dotnet.exe` and `node.exe` processes running simultaneously, overwhelming the system
3. **Connection Pooling Issues**: Using `Connection: keep-alive` headers without proper cleanup
4. **Slow Timeout Detection**: 30-second timeouts causing poor user experience

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Fixed AbortController Management
**File:** `ClientApp/src/services/api.ts`
```typescript
// BEFORE: Shared singleton causing conflicts
class ConnectionManager {
  private abortController: AbortController | null = null;
  // Single controller shared across all requests - PROBLEMATIC
}

// AFTER: Individual controllers per request
function createTimeoutSignal(timeoutMs: number): AbortSignal {
  const controller = new AbortController();
  setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), timeoutMs);
  return controller.signal;
}
```

### 2. Connection Header Optimization
```typescript
// BEFORE: Keep-alive causing leaks
headers: {
  'Connection': 'keep-alive',
}

// AFTER: Close connections to prevent leaks
headers: {
  'Connection': 'close',
}
```

### 3. Timeout Reduction
```typescript
// BEFORE: 30 second timeout
private timeoutMs: number = 30000;

// AFTER: 10 second timeout for faster response
private timeoutMs: number = 10000;
```

### 4. Process Cleanup
```bash
# Killed all existing processes
taskkill //F //IM dotnet.exe
taskkill //F //IM node.exe
```

## Verification Results

### API Endpoints Working ✅
```bash
# Health Check
curl -k https://localhost:5001/api/dashboard/health
# → {"status":"healthy","timestamp":"2025-06-02T15:54:08Z","message":"API is operational"}

# Dashboard Stats  
curl -k https://localhost:5001/api/dashboard/stats
# → {"totalProducts":0,"totalDeals":0,...} (Full JSON response)
```

### Terminal Output Success ✅
```
→ GET /api/deals/top
→ GET /api/dashboard/stats  
→ GET /api/dashboard/health
← 200 /api/dashboard/health
← 200 /api/deals/top
← 200 /api/dashboard/stats
```

### User Experience Improved ✅
1. Dashboard now shows "Checking API Connection..." loading state first
2. Transitions to "API Connected" green status indicator
3. Displays actual data with skeleton loading cards
4. No more immediate error messages on page load

## Files Modified
- ✅ `ClientApp/src/services/api.ts` - Fixed ConnectionManager and timeout logic
- ✅ `ClientApp/src/hooks/useApi.ts` - Enhanced loading state management  
- ✅ `ClientApp/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` - Improved loading UI components

## Performance Impact
- **Request Speed**: 10s timeout vs 30s (3x faster failure detection)
- **Connection Health**: No more connection leaks or process multiplication
- **User Experience**: Proper loading states → connected status → data display
- **Memory Usage**: Reduced from multiple process overhead

## Testing Completed
- [x] Health endpoint responds correctly
- [x] Stats endpoint returns proper JSON
- [x] Dashboard shows loading states first
- [x] No timeout errors in console
- [x] Proper API connection flow
- [x] No process multiplication issues

**Resolution Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**  
**Next Steps:** Monitor for any regression and continue with feature development.
