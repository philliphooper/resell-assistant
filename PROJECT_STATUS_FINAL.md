## 🔧 **TECHNICAL RESOLUTION SUMMARY**

### **Problem Solved**: 
Users were getting "eBay credentials are configured but connection test failed" errors despite having valid production credentials.

### **Root Cause Identified**: 
Architectural flaws in `EbayApiService.cs` that prevented proper credential retrieval and OAuth authentication.

### **Key Fixes Implemented**:

1. **🔗 Service Architecture Fixed**
   - Added missing `ICredentialService` dependency injection
   - Fixed credential retrieval in `RefreshAccessTokenAsync()`
   - Updated `TestConnectionAsync()` logic for proper validation

2. **🔐 OAuth Configuration Corrected**
   - Fixed OAuth endpoint: `api.ebay.com` → `auth.ebay.com`
   - Implemented proper credential-based token refresh

3. **🏭 Production Environment Ready**
   - Changed all defaults from sandbox to production
   - Updated API URLs to production endpoints
   - Set environment configuration to "production"

4. **🛡️ Reliability Enhanced**
   - Added semaphore protection with proper exception handling
   - Implemented `finally` blocks to prevent resource leaks
