## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET 9 SDK
- Node.js 18+
- npm

### Quick Start

The easiest way to start the application is using the provided startup scripts:

**For Windows:**
```bash
start-dev.bat
```

**For Linux/Mac:**
```bash
chmod +x start-dev.sh
./start-dev.sh
```

**Or manually:**
```bash
cd "Resell Assistant"
dotnet run
```

This single command will:
1. Start the .NET backend on ports 5000 (HTTP) and 5001 (HTTPS)
2. Automatically start the React frontend on port 3000
3. Configure proxy routing between frontend and backend

### How It Works

- **Backend**: .NET Web API serves on https://localhost:5001
- **Frontend**: React dev server runs on http://localhost:3000
- **Communication**: React proxies API calls to the .NET backend
- **Access**: Open https://localhost:5001 in your browser (the .NET app will proxy to React)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/philliphooper/resell-assistant.git
cd resell-assistant
```

2. Install frontend dependencies:
```bash
cd "Resell Assistant/ClientApp"
npm install
```

3. Install backend dependencies:
```bash

```

4. Run the application:
```bash
dotnet run
```

The application will be available at `https://localhost:5001`

## API Configuration
